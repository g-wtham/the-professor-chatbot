# The Professor Chatbot

### Layman to Einstein-level explanation at your fingertips!

Everytime you ask a concept to chatbot, it gonna confuse you with an explanation that's way out of your understanding or too simple to be useless. Turns out that I can solve our universal issue!

Simply, adjust the slider based on your desired level of explanation (1 - Kudos babyy!; 5 - Hello, Einstein!). Everything inbetween acts as side-characters with **SIMPLE** to **MEDIUM** level explanations.

Not just **explanations**, pairing it up with **example**, so you can wrap the concept around your head better this time than smashing the keyboard once again, bombing chatgpt with your vocabulary skills!
